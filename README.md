####What's this for?

Re-routes any non-https URL requests to the appropriate HTTPS URL automatically.

####Do I need anything special?

Your website needs to have an SSL certificate that is already properly installed. This plugin does not create an HTTPS connection for you, just re-routes non-HTTPS to HTTPS.

#####Can't I just set my default URL to the "https" version?

You can. But if users visit the "http" version of the site, it won't forward to the "https" by default unless they click on a link on the page.

#####Can I select which pages the plugin gets activated in?

Not yet, but maybe in the future. You're more than welcome to add this feature to the plugin if you'd like.

#####How do I install?
* Download the ZIP file in the repo
* Go to the Plugins page in your Wordpress website
* Click on the "Add New" button
* Upload the ZIP file you just downloaded
* Activate the plugin
